# React Counter App

## Overview

This project is a simple and interactive Counter application built with React, developed independently as part of a remote Web Development Internship at Codveda Technologies.

The application was created to practice and demonstrate core React concepts, including components, state management, hooks, event handling and basic accessibility practices.

## Project Scope

This project was fully implemented by me and focuses on frontend fundamentals rather than complex business logic or backend integration.

## Features

- Increment and decrement the counter value
- Reset the counter back to 0
- Adjustable step value (range: 1–50)
- Step input validation to prevent invalid values
- Keyboard support:
  - Arrow Up: increase counter
  - Arrow Down: decrease counter
  - R: reset counter
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Basic accessibility support:
  - `aria-label`
  - `aria-live`
- Clean UI with simple animations and hover effects

## Tech Stack
- React (Hooks)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Flexbox & Grid)
